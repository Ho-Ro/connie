connie 0.4.1 (summer in the city)
Created a second organ model (test): 9 stops, percussion and vibrato.
Cmd line args: 
  -a : autoconnect to system:playback ports
  -f : french AZERTY keyboard

connie 0.4.0 (land ho!)
I like this version - it's a big step forward
Last version "in the cage" used preconfigured mixture samples to 
reduce cpu load. The fixed freq ratio of 3:4:5:8 led to clean sound 
suitable for a church pipe organ but not for an analog multiplex organ.

This version combines the mixture from the equal temp. voices with
the effect of the vivid cutting sound.
New:
Three voices: flute=sine, reed=rect (sounds more like vox), sharp=saw
Percussion added
Leslie fm parameter reduced - sounds more realistic
Optimized realtime callback function reduces cpu load.
Midi cc 120 (all sound off) and 123 (all notes off) recognized
Midi pitch bend 
Cmd line argument --autoconnect

connie 0.3.2 (in the cage)
name changed Connie -> connie
first debianized version
use different samples (only reed voice) for each octave
fill with bandlimited sawtooth (fmax < fsample/3) to avoid aliasing
average between sample buffer at octave border to avoid ugly sound "jumps"
vibrato parameter corrected
preset programs - select via pc kbd or midi

2009-06-07
