Description: Electronic organ like e.g. Vox Continental with JACK interface
 Connie is an electronic organ program with JACK midi in and JACK audio out.
 The program simulates the signal flow of a typical analog polyphonic organ.
 Besides sounding nice the source code is intended as a toolbox for writing
 and testing own signal processing solutions.
